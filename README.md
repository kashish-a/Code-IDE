# Intelligent IDE with AI-Driven Code Generation & Debugging

This project is a proof-of-concept demonstrating an **Intelligent IDE** built with Streamlit and AI-powered code generation. The app includes features such as:

- **Automated Code Generation:** Generate code from natural language descriptions using a Hugging Face model.(Saleforce codegen)
- **In-App Code Editing:** Write and analyze your code with built-in static analysis.
- **Unit Test Generation:** Auto-generate unit tests based on your code.
- **Advanced Debugging:** Run your code and get AI-suggested fixes for any runtime errors.
- **CI Simulation:** Simulate a continuous integration pipeline that executes your code and tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
